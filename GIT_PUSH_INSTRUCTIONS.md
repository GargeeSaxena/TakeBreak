# 📤 Git Push Instructions for TakeBreak

## 🚀 How to Push to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your TakeBreak project to GitHub: https://github.com/GargeeSaxena/TakeBreak.git

---

## Step 1: Open Command Prompt/Terminal

Navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd C:\AndroidProjects\TakeBreak
```

---

## Step 2: Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
git init
```

---

## Step 3: Add Remote Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/GargeeSaxena/TakeBreak.git
```

If you get "remote origin already exists", remove it first:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/GargeeSaxena/TakeBreak.git
```

---

## Step 4: Add All Files

```bash
git add .
```

---

## Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "v0.2.0: Time-based break system with exercises and smart snooze"
```

---

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about branch name, try:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you need to force push (only if repository has conflicts):
```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

If prompted for credentials:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. Use token as password when prompted

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
gh auth login
# Follow prompts
git push -u origin main
```
