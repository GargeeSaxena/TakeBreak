## 🔐 Authentication

When prompted for username/password:

**Username:** Your GitHub username (GargeeSaxena)

**Password:** Use **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)

### How to Get Token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Generate token
5. **Copy it immediately** (you won't see it again!)
6. Use this token as your password

---

## ✅ Success!

After pushing, go to:
https://github.com/GargeeSaxena/TakeBreak

You should see all your files!

## 🐛 Common Errors

### Error: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the right folder:
```bash
cd C:\AndroidProjects\TakeBreak
git init
```

### Error: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Use Personal Access Token, not password

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
**Solution:** Pull first, then push:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Error: "Repository not found"
**Solution:** Check you have access to the repo. Try HTTPS URL:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GargeeSaxena/TakeBreak.git
```
