### ✅ Scheduled Break Times
Choose interval, get breaks at specific times:

**15-minute intervals:**
- 9:15, 9:30, 9:45, 10:00, 10:15, 10:30...

## 🌐 Chrome Extension - How It Works Now

### Setup Flow:
```
1. Click extension icon
2. Set work hours: Start 9:00, End 23:00
3. Choose interval: 15/30/45/60 minutes
4. Click "Activate Breaks"
5. Extension calculates scheduled break times
6. Waits until next break time
```

### Break Flow:
```
Work Time → Scheduled time reached (e.g., 9:30)
         → Notification appears
         → User choice:
            A) Take Break Now → 3-min break page opens
            B) Snooze 5 min → Delay for 5 minutes
         → After 3 snoozes → FORCE BREAK (automatic)
```

### Example Timeline (30-min interval, 9:00-23:00):
```
9:00 AM  - Work starts, extension activated
9:30 AM  - 🔔 First break notification
           User snoozes → Now 9:35 AM
9:35 AM  - 🔔 Snoozed break (count: 1)
           User snoozes → Now 9:40 AM
9:40 AM  - 🔔 Snoozed break (count: 2)
           User snoozes → Now 9:45 AM
9:45 AM  - 🔔 Snoozed break (count: 3)
           User snoozes → Now 9:50 AM
9:50 AM  - 🚨 FORCE BREAK (auto-opens)
           Must complete 3-minute break
           Snooze count resets to 0
10:00 AM - Next scheduled break
```

## 🎯 Key Differences from Before

### ❌ OLD System (Wrong):
- Continuous countdown timer
- Breaks every X minutes from start
- Example: Timer starts at 9:00, break at 9:20, 9:40, 10:00...

### ✅ NEW System (Correct):
- **Scheduled break times**
- Breaks at specific clock times
- Example: Breaks at 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00...
- **Only during work hours**

---

## 💡 Why This System is Better

### Predictable:
- Know exactly when breaks will occur
- 30-min interval = breaks on the hour and half-hour
- Easy to plan around

### Professional:
- Aligns with meeting schedules
- Respects work patterns
- More natural rhythm

### Flexible:
- Set your own work hours
- Skip days by not activating
